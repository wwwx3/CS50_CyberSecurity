# CS50 Cybersecurity — Code & Notes

## Overview

This repository contains my **code implementations, experiments, and structured notes** from **CS50’s Introduction to Cybersecurity**.

The goal of this repo is **not just to finish exercises**, but to:

* understand **security concepts at a systems level**
* connect theory → implementation
* document *why* things work, not just *that* they work

This repo is part of my long-term preparation in **systems, security foundations, and responsible computing**.

## What’s inside

### Concepts covered :

* Networking fundamentals
* Threat models & attack surfaces
* Authentication & authorization
* Web security basics
* Cryptography (conceptual level)
* Secure system thinking

Each topic includes:

* short personal notes
* annotated code (where applicable)
* reflections on limitations & assumptions

---

### 💻 Code

The code in this repository is:

* written for **learning clarity** .
* intentionally readable and modular
* paired with comments explaining *what problem is being solved*

> I prioritize understanding **how an attack or defense works**, rather than just reproducing results.

---

### Notes & Reflections

For each major topic, I include:

* a brief summary in my own words
* key takeaways in bullet points
* questions I want to explore further

These notes help me:

* retain concepts long-term
* explain security ideas clearly to others
* build a responsible mindset around cybersecurity

---

I’m building **strong conceptual foundations** that I can later apply to:

* AI systems
* infrastructure
* secure deployments

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All code and notes in this repository are for **educational purposes only**.
No content here is intended for misuse or unethical activities.

Responsible learning and ethical awareness are core values of this work.

---

This repository is **actively updated** as I:

* progress through CS50 Cybersecurity
* refine my understanding
* connect security concepts to real systems

---

## Final note

> *“Security is not about breaking things — it’s about understanding systems well enough to protect them.”*
